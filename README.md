# Miramontes Coding Explanation

I understood the pdf as being broken up into five sections: the navbar, hero, article row, highlight, and the footer. Since I was not allowed to use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation, I applied the principles of their grid framework and recreated a grid based on their one, two, and three column fluid layouts. The navbar, hero, and footer sections would be broken up into two columns while the article row would consist of three columns and the hero section would be a single column. I isolated the color values using the MacOS built-in Digital Color Meter which gave me rbg values which I then used an online tool to turn those RGB values into hex values. I initially thought the white text of the highlight section was a strange rendering quirk of the PDF, but a quick search showed me I could replicate the styling.  I opted to use rem units for font measurements as they are scaleable units which would resize nicely across viewports. It was the scaleability of REM units that led me to use fixed pixel values for styling elements.
